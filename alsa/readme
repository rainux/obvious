Alsa widget

This widget uses amixer to set/get current volume level. It is rather similar
to volume_alsa, but differs in several ways:
  - Cards and controls can be changed using context menu
  - Volume level is displayed using progress bars for both Left and Right
    channels
  - It uses tooltip (A recent awesome version is required)

To use this awesome widget change your rc.lua configuration:

require("obvious.alsa")
...
obvious_alsa = obvious.alsa({})

and in the wibox status bar add:

    obvious_alsa.get_widgets()

See init.lua file for complete usage.
